Apart from the claims representing VO  and VO  the respondent does not dispute that the remaining amounts would have been due and payable had the applicant’s work been completed satisfactorily   In that regard the respondent contends that it suffered loss and damage as a result of it having to make good work undertaken by the applicant in relation to two projects where the applicant was contracted by the respondent Consequently the respondent seeks to set  off so much of the applicant's claim commensurate with that alleged loss and damage In particular the amount sought to be set off is said to be as follows  a Lot   Cade Grove   , .   b Lot   Cade Grove   , .

pertaining to an alleged domestic building contract or the carrying out of domestic building work is i n dispute The identity of the builder entity is in dispute The terms and specifications of the work to be carried out are in dispute The consideration to be paid for the work to be carried out is disputed Only partial payment has been made by the Appli cant for the work carried out The alleged contract arose from what the Tribunal finds was initially a low level social community and even personal relationship In the context of this relationship the Applicant knew the Second Respondent as being in th e business of painting and decorating He had previously arranged for some painting to be carried out at premises  other than the premises the subject of the current proceedings in which she had an interest Very briefly and in general terms in early     the Applicant raised with the Second Respondent the  GTKH \\x03XGTUKQP KIPGF\\x03D \\x03#WUV

Hamden Road Armadale The most significant and indeed the only item of building work relevant to these proceedings  insofar as remedy is sought from the Tribunal only in respect of this item was the construction of two arches in the lower storey of this residence These arches were to be constructed where previously there was in one instance a double door  way and in the other a single door  way The Second Respondent said he could and would arrange such Indeed he did subsequently arrange such but the work was not carried out to the satisfaction of the Applicant and she witheld monies due to him on account o f that There was an initial issue of proceedings in the Magistrates Court in which recovery was sought from the Applicant for the balance of the monies allegedly owing for the work performed These proceedings were discontinued by consent and proceedings were subsequently issued in this Tribunal by the Applicant in these proceedings the Defendant in the complaint in the Magistrates Court proceedings In these proceedings the Applicant seeks an order by way of compensation for loss for the payment of monies sufficient to rectify the works which in the Applicant's submission amounts to a complete demolishing and reconstruction of the works done With respect to the entities to the alleged agreement the Applicant is clearly the named individual On the other hand the Second Respondent who gave unsworn evidence by way of telephone communication  due to ill health contended that proceedings in the Tribunal have been inappropriately and incorrectly issued against the First Respondent He contends tha t the work was carried out by Consolidated Building Maintenance Pty Ltd a company whose existence ceased on   July   when its assets and liabilities were taken over by a company called Maintenance Team Pty Ltd whose Directors were the wife and step  daughter of the Second Respondent Consolidated Building Maintenance Pty Ltd  ACN       was a company which according to Mr Opat employed Mr Albie Beck through a decision of a Director Mr Ian Harding It was Mr Beck who initially at least wa s given the responsibility by Mr Opat of organising the sub  contractors and the work to be carried out at Mrs Buch's house Moreover it was to Consolidated Building Maintenance Pty Ltd that a cheque for   ,  was made out by Mrs Buch for part performanc e of the work carried out The Tribunal finds that the cheque was made out to this company at the request of Mr Opat and that until that time Mrs Buch was unaware of the existence of that company Maintenance Team Pty Ltd  ACN       to which refe rence is made above is only relevant insofar as a   ,  cash further payment paid to Mr Opat by Mrs Buch for the work performed was said by Mr Opat to have been received by him on behalf of Maintenance Team Pty Ltd Mr Opat supports this contention by re ference to what on its face is a receipt for that cash on the letter  head of Maintenance Team Pty Ltd from P.O Box   Cheltenham and dated   October   Counsel for the Applicant attempted to discredit the evidentiary value of that receipt by rai sing issues concerning the date from which the prefix '  was attached to Melbourne telephone numbers concerning the proper address of the subject company at that time and concerning the stage at which the particular receipt came to light To this it must be said that the relevant date is not within the Tribunal's knowledge and no evidence was led about it Further while the other matters raised by Counsel do tend to raise doubts about the authenticity of the receipt they are insufficient in themselves to altogether rebut their evidentiary value However when considered in the context of the receipt signed by Mr Opat and dated   October   for a    cash payment received from Mrs Buch and written on a 'With Compliments slip of Opat Decorating Se rvice Vic Pty Ltd the evidentiary value of the exhibited receipt from Maintenance Team Pty Ltd as

Reference No D /  Page   of     Twelve Newton Street Surrey Hills was a Californian Bungalow with a more recent extension at the rear In   the property was in a poor condition Its owner Ms Kerrie Bourke the applicant in this proceeding entered into a contract with Capital Building Contractors Pty Ltd the respondent to demolish the old extension and replace it with a ground floor extension consisting of a master bedroom kitchen laundry rumpus lounge a study deck pergola and bathroom Plans had been prepared in September depicting the work to be carried out The contract price inclusive of Goods and Services Tax was under the contract   ,    The contract documents prepared by the builder assumed that in addition to Ms Bourke her husband Mr Peter Bourke would also be a party Mr Bourke declined to sign the contract He said he was ‘a man of straw When I enquired of Mr Bourke during the h earing what he meant by this phrase specifically was he for instance an undischarged bankrupt he said that he is a chartered accountant by profession and had hopes and expectations of being admitted to partnership in his firm He therefore avoided ownin g any property in his own name I too k that to mean that were a judg ment entered against him and his partners in the future there would so far as his family was concerned be no pro perty which could be seized for the benefit of creditors   Demolition of the old extension commenced before Christmas   According to Mr Peter Harnishmacher the principal of Capital the demolition included in addition to the removal of the extension areas themselves removal of all larth and plaster walls and the demolit ion of two chimneys He said that Capital straightened and reinforced the walls of the remaining structure He continued Two main supporting walls had to be reinforced and packed out to bring them in line with an earlier rear extension which was also ou t of square   Once the old extension was demolished a sub  floor area was exposed to the elements Ms Bourke said that there was a lot of rain around Christmas   Mr Harnishmacher said The existing particleboard did not handle the rain on it at the t ime and went from

prominent role in the management of the contract even although he was not a party to it was of opinion that the damage to the old floor occurred because Capital failed to take prudent action such as protecting it with tarpaulin He said the destruction of the old floor was Capital’s fault and Capital should pay for it Capital stopped work The Bourkes then threatened to take the dispute to this Tr ibunal In an e  mail dated   January   Mr Harnishmacher after complaining of the Bourkes refusal to ‘discuss our options on site said Capital is prepared to make the following offer We will replace faulty particleboard at our expense Please adv ise if you are happy to proceed on this basis Ms Bourke accepted this proposal and no proceeding was commenced at this Tribunal at that time   The plans referred to in the contract had been prepared in September   Amended plans were prepared in Marc h   The Bourkes had second thoughts as to a number of matters and variations were raised Without canvassing the d etail at this stage the Bourkes saw these arrangements as entailing them being charged the cost of the extra work plus a builder’s marg in of   Mr Harnishmacher on behalf of Capital

building   Both the September   plans and the March   plan provided for a glazed area of six panels at the rear of the house with a swinging door as part of the complex The Bourkes elected to have sliding door s in lieu By about April one particularly important change to the project was under discussion The contract initially contemplated that a pergola would be included After signing the contract Ms Bourke said she became aware that her child was hyp ersen sitive to mosquito bites T herefore the family would not have any good use for a pergola where their child might suffer mosquito bites The proposal then was to convert the pergola into a sunroom which would be entirely enclosed and protected from mosqui toes This arrangement was ultimately agreed upon According to Mr Harnishmacher the standard windows which his company purchased from an organisation called ‘Trend once converted to sliding door rather than swinging doors were too large to accommodate the six panel

       " \"REASONS Background   The Applicant is the owner of a residential property located in Point Cook The property comprises a single storey brick dwelling with a double car garage The dwelling and garage were constructed by Porter Davis Homes At the time when the applicant took possession of the property there was no landscaping or driveway constructed as that work was not within the scope of the work undertaken by Porter Davis Homes   Consequently the Applicant contacted the respondent Mr Abdallah to enquire as to the cost of the proposed landscaping work and the construction of a driveway On   May   the parties met at the Applicant’s sister’s home to discuss the scope of the proposed work Although there is general agreement as to the scope of the landscaping work undertaken by Mr Abdallah the parties are at odds as to whether the construction of the driveway formed part of Mr Abdallah’s contract or alternatively was pursuant to a separate contract between the Second Respondent a nd the Applicant In that regard Mr Abdallah contends that he merely acted as a conduit between the Second Respondent and the Applicant whereas the Applicant contends that the Second Respondent was a subcontractor of Mr Abdallah   Much turns on this qu estion because the Applicant c laims that the construction of the driveway is defective and not in accordance with express instructions as to its design In particular the as  built driveway sweeps in a curve from the cross  over which is located adjacent to the left boundary of the property into the garage which is positioned centrally According to the Applicant the sweep or curve of the driveway makes it extremely difficult to drive two cars into the garage She contends that she gave specific instruction s to Mr Abdallah that she wanted a straight driveway Obviously this would have required moving the cross  over from the left to the centre of the property   The Applicant claims   ,  from Mr Abdallah for the cost of re constructing the driveway and m oving the cross  over This amount also includes a claim that the landscaping work was not fully completed by Mr Abdallah By contrast Mr Abdallah counterclaims against the Applicant for   ,  representing the balance outstanding in respect of the origin ally quoted landscaping work plus an additional   ,  for variation work   A number of issues arise for consideration  a Who employed the Second Respondent  GTKH \\x03XGTUKQP KIPGF\\x03D \\x03#WUV  GVTKGXGF\\x03HTQO\\x03#WUV.++\\x03QP\\x03\\x14\\x16\\x03 GDTWCT \\x03\\x14\\x12\\x14\\x15\\x03CV \\x17\\x15VCAT Reference No D /  Page   of    b Was the driveway meant to be straight  c Is the driveway defective  d Are the landscaping works defective or incomplete  e What amount remains to be paid under the landscaping contract Who employed the Second Respondent   A number of witnesses were called to give evidence on behalf of the Applicant Affidavits were filed and adopted as their evidence in chief According to the affidavit of Ms Tamean Nasr the sister of the Applicant Mr Abdallah met the Applicant and members of the Applicant's family at Ms Nasr’s home on   May   She st ates in her affidavit that Mr Abdallah made an offer to complete concreting of the driveway in addition to the landscaping work In particular My sister’s property has a double garage and she requested the Respondent to have the driveway opposite the gar age to ensure easy access to the garage She also advised him if for any reason he can't to let her know prior to the commencement of the work My sister asked not once but at least   times prior to the work commencing if she needed to do anything con tact the Council or the ARC from Sanctuary lakes and I translated this to the Respondent in which at all times his response was she did not need to do anything and he will do everything that is required I translated this to the Respondent and again asked him if he understood and he said yes This was done in front of several other people   Ms Nasr also gave oral evidence during the course of the hearing In that regard her recollection of what was said during the course of that meeting was somewhat vag ue My impression after hearing her oral evidence was that in all likelihood the drafting of her affidavit was not entirely by her own hand In particular she was unable to recall with any specificity some of the matters set out in her affidavit when ask ed to elaborate on those matters For example the Applicant asked her to recount whether Mr Abdallah was asked whether council approval was needed Ms Nasr recounted that Mr Abdallah simply said no Ms Nasr said nothing about having raised the issue with Mr Abdallah on four separate occasions or anything about seeking consent from any other organisation   Ms Nasr also said that Mr Abdallah drew a sketch plan of the proposed driveway and landscaping work although that document could not be produced by e ither party  GTKH \\x03XGTUKQP\",\n",

Hamden Road Armadale The most significant and indeed the only item of building work relevant to these proceedings  insofar as remedy is sought from the Tribunal only in respect of this item was the construction of two arches in the lower storey of this residence These arches were to be constructed where previously there was in one instance a double door  way and in the other a single door  way The Second Respondent said he could and would arrange such Indeed he did subsequently arrange such but the work was not carried out to the satisfaction of the Applicant and she witheld monies due to him on account o f that There was an initial issue of proceedings in the Magistrates Court in which recovery was sought from the Applicant for the balance of the monies allegedly owing for the work performed These proceedings were discontinued by consent and proceedings were subsequently issued in this Tribunal by the Applicant in these proceedings the Defendant in the complaint in the Magistrates Court proceedings In these proceedings the Applicant seeks an order by way of compensation for loss for the payment of monies sufficient to rectify the works which in the Applicant's submission amounts to a complete demolishing and reconstruction of the works done With respect to the entities to the alleged agreement the Applicant is clearly the named individual On the other hand the Second Respondent who gave unsworn evidence by way of telephone communication  due to ill health contended that proceedings in the Tribunal have been inappropriately and incorrectly issued against the First Respondent He contends tha t the work was carried out by Consolidated Building Maintenance Pty Ltd a company whose existence ceased on   July   when its assets and liabilities were taken over by a company called Maintenance Team Pty Ltd whose Directors were the wife and step  daughter of the Second Respondent Consolidated Building Maintenance Pty Ltd  ACN       was a company which according to Mr Opat employed Mr Albie Beck through a decision of a Director Mr Ian Harding It was Mr Beck who initially at least wa s given the responsibility by Mr Opat of organising the sub  contractors and the work to be carried out at Mrs Buch's house Moreover it was to Consolidated Building Maintenance Pty Ltd that a cheque for   ,  was made out by Mrs Buch for part performanc e of the work carried out The Tribunal finds that the cheque was made out to this company at the request of Mr Opat and that until that time Mrs Buch was unaware of the existence of that company Maintenance Team Pty Ltd  ACN       to which refe rence is made above is only relevant insofar as a   ,  cash further payment paid to Mr Opat by Mrs Buch for the work performed was said by Mr Opat to have been received by him on behalf of Maintenance Team Pty Ltd Mr Opat supports this contention by re ference to what on its face is a receipt for that cash on the letter  head of Maintenance Team Pty Ltd from P.O Box   Cheltenham and dated   October   Counsel for the Applicant attempted to discredit the evidentiary value of that receipt by rai sing issues concerning the date from which the prefix '  was attached to Melbourne telephone numbers concerning the proper address of the subject company at that time and concerning the stage at which the particular receipt came to light To this it must be said that the relevant date is not within the Tribunal's knowledge and no evidence was led about it Further while the other matters raised by Counsel do tend to raise doubts about the authenticity of the receipt they are insufficient in themselves to altogether rebut their evidentiary value However when considered in the context of the receipt signed by Mr Opat and dated   October   for a    cash payment received from Mrs Buch and written on a 'With Compliments slip of Opat Decorating Se rvice Vic Pty Ltd the evidentiary value of the exhibited receipt from Maintenance Team Pty Ltd as indicative of the entity which was a party to the work arrangements lapses into insignificance It is not credible that a receipt having been issued fo r the   ,  cash on an Opat Decorating Service Vic

       " 'REASONS Introduction   Mr Wenbo Liu applies for review of a decision made by the Building Practitioners Board ‘BPB or ‘Board to refuse him regist ration as a domestic builder  unlimi ted under s     of the Building Act    ‘the Building Act Background   On   April   Mr Liu was registered as a building practitioner in the class domestic builder  manager  ‘DB M pursuant to s     of the Building Act   On the same day Mr Liu submitted an application for registration as a building practitioner in the class domestic bu ilder  unlimited  ‘DB U The application was based on the same documents which had formed the basis of Mr Liu’s application to be registe red as a DB  M   Between the date of the application and August   Mr Liu provided the BPB with additional information   On   May   Mr Liu undertook a computer based assessment   On   August   Mr Liu was assessed in an interview by Mr George Stefanidis in which Mr Stefanidis formed the view that Mr Liu lacked “the relevant   years of practical experience that is required of a DBU M r Stefanidis outli ned further experience required by Mr Liu for registration as a DB  U   On   August   the BP B notified Mr Liu by letter of its decision to refuse him registration in the category of DB  U on the basis that The Board found that you do not hold the prescribed qualifications under section   of the Building Act    the Act Division   Part   an d as described in Schedule   of the Building Regulations   Application for review   On   September   Mr Liu lodged this application for review on the following grounds   I got the approval of domestic builder  manager registration issued by BPB on  th Apr.   letter as attached which means BPB agreed that I met and held the domestic builder registration qualification prescribed under section   of the Building Act   Division Part   and as prescribed in Schedule   of the Building Reg   How come after half a year a nother assessor from BPB found I did not hold qualification as require by the same law when I applied for Domestic builder unlimited registration sinc e no amendment or alteration has been introduced to the Building Act and Building Reg during the less than half a year period  GTKH \\x03XGTUKQP KIPGF\\x03D \\x03#WUV  GVTKGXGF\\x03HTQO\\x03#WUV.++\\x03QP\\x03\\x14\\x16\\x03 GDTWCT \\x03\\x14\\x12\\x14\\x15\\x03CV \\x12\\x1bVCAT Reference No Z /  Page   of     BPB permitted me to have sit various tests including the computer based test error check and face to face interview for domes tic building unlimited registration only after they found that I am eligible for such test that means only in the circumstances that they found that I am holding the domestic building registration and meet the law req uirements after they checked and reviewed my application documents However my assessor Mr George in the process of the face to face interview told me before the test started that he would not allow me to pass even if I got hundred percent correct in all the questions he would questio n because he found that I did not hold registration qualification When I asked him why I was allowed to sit such test and other previous tests since I am not eligible to attend it and waste his and my time Even he himself said that he did not understand it either So the refusal is absolutely an outcome of different understandings of law requirement by different assessors from BPB But I am the victim   I am holding the qualifications for domestic builder unlimited application as prescribed in the Build ing Act and Building Reg I have Certificate III Building and Construction issued by Holmesglen Tafe  as attached and nearly ten years experience in the building and construction industry sic   Mr Liu did not submit any further documents in respect of this application to review despite a direction from the Tribunal to do so by   September   However at the hearing on   November Mr Liu tendered five building permits  which he contend ed demonstrate further relevant experience   Mr Liu’s failure to provide further documentation as ordered has not assisted him in this proceeding For example when cross  examining Ms Georgia McKay the expert witness building consultant who gave eviden ce for the BPB Mr Liu remarked that he wished he had provided photographs of some of his work Another example is that Mr Liu cross  examined Ms McKay as to the complexity of finishing the work of other builders Her answer was that this is complex work b ut she did not have the benefit of knowing what he had done particularly in dealing with any problems encountered Conduct of the assessor   It is convenient to deal with the first of Mr Liu’s grounds for review briefly This is the point raised at parag raph   of the grounds for review referred to above where it is said by Mr Liu that Mr George in the process of the face to face interview told me before the test started that he would not al low me to pass even if I got hundred percent correct in all the q uestions   See paragraphs   to   below  GTKH \\x03XGTUKQP',\n",

Hamden Road Armadale The most significant and indeed the only item of building work relevant to these proceedings  insofar as remedy is sought from the Tribunal only in respect of this item was the construction of two arches in the lower storey of this residence These arches were to be constructed where previously there was in one instance a double door  way and in the other a single door  way The Second Respondent said he could and would arrange such Indeed he did subsequently arrange such but the work was not carried out to the satisfaction of the Applicant and she witheld monies due to him on account o f that There was an initial issue of proceedings in the Magistrates Court in which recovery was sought from the Applicant for the balance of the monies allegedly owing for the work performed These proceedings were discontinued by consent and proceedings were subsequently issued in this Tribunal by the Applicant in these proceedings the Defendant in the complaint in the Magistrates Court proceedings In these proceedings the Applicant seeks an order by way of compensation for loss for the payment of monies sufficient to rectify the works which in the Applicant's submission amounts to a complete demolishing and reconstruction of the works done With respect to the entities to the alleged agreement the Applicant is clearly the named individual On the other hand the Second Respondent who gave unsworn evidence by way of telephone communication  due to ill health contended that proceedings in the Tribunal have been inappropriately and incorrectly issued against the First Respondent He contends tha t the work was carried out by Consolidated Building Maintenance Pty Ltd a company whose existence ceased on   July   when its assets and liabilities were taken over by a company called Maintenance Team Pty Ltd whose Directors were the wife and step  daughter of the Second Respondent Consolidated Building Maintenance Pty Ltd  ACN       was a company which according to Mr Opat employed Mr Albie Beck through a decision of a Director Mr Ian Harding It was Mr Beck who initially at least wa s given the responsibility by Mr Opat of organising the sub  contractors and the work to be carried out at Mrs Buch's house Moreover it was to Consolidated Building Maintenance Pty Ltd that a cheque for   ,  was made out by Mrs Buch for part performanc e of the work carried out The Tribunal finds that the cheque was made out to this company at the request of Mr Opat and that until that time Mrs Buch was unaware of the existence of that company Maintenance Team Pty Ltd  ACN       to which refe rence is made above is only relevant insofar as a   ,  cash further payment paid to Mr Opat by Mrs Buch for the work performed was said by Mr Opat to have been received by him on behalf of Maintenance Team Pty Ltd Mr Opat supports this contention by re ference to what on its face is a receipt for that cash on the letter  head of Maintenance Team Pty Ltd from P.O Box   Cheltenham and dated   October   Counsel for the Applicant attempted to discredit the evidentiary value of that receipt by rai sing issues concerning the date from which the prefix '  was

Builder but the Owners became dissatisfied with the work and so they terminated the contract with the O riginal Builder and completed the House themselves   The Owners obtained an award of damages in this Tribunal against the Original Builder but it went into liquidation and the award was not satisfied The Owners then made a claim on a policy of domestic building insurance that had been issued by Calliden Insurance Ltd  “the Insurer with respect to the construction by the Original Builder   The principal problem with the House was that it had substantial drainage problems largely because it had been c onstructed at too low a level and water was ponding around it   The Insurer sent out a number of experts to inspect the House These included Mr Rodwell a consulting engineer a building consultant Mr Simpson and two plumbing consultants Mr McNees a nd Mr Dower   In his report to the insurer Mr Rodwell noted that the House had been built too low into the ground which he said had created drainage problems He prepared some designs for remedial work that he said ought to be undertaken to resolve the situation F ollowing some discussions with the Owners he subsequently prepared three further alternate designs   Apart from the drainage problem there were items of defective work claimed The Insurer accepted for some of these but denied liability fo r others The principal defect was a blocked sewer pipe under the laundry floor   A document entitled “I nspection Summary  “the Inspection Summary are setting out a scope of works was prepared by the Insurer s consultant Mr

August   DATE OF ORDER   September   REASONS FOR ORDER/S These proceedings relate to a domestic building dispute in which virtually every element is in dispute In particular almost every element pertaining to an alleged domestic building contract or the carrying out of domestic building work is i n dispute The identity of the builder entity is in dispute The terms and specifications of the work to be carried out are in dispute The consideration to be paid for the work to be carried out is disputed Only partial payment has been made by the Appli cant for the work carried out The alleged contract arose from what the Tribunal finds was initially a low level social community and even personal relationship In the context of this relationship the Applicant knew the Second Respondent as being in th e business of painting and decorating He had previously arranged for some painting to be carried out at premises  other than the premises the subject of the current proceedings in which she had an interest Very briefly and in general terms in early     the Applicant raised with the Second Respondent the  GTKH \\x03XGTUKQP KIPGF\\x03D \\x03#WUV

Hamden Road Armadale The most significant and indeed the only item of building work relevant to these proceedings  insofar as remedy is sought from the Tribunal only in respect of this item was the construction of two arches in the lower storey of this residence These arches were to be constructed where previously there was in one instance a double door  way and in the other a single door  way The Second Respondent said he could and would arrange such Indeed he did subsequently arrange such but the work was not carried out to the satisfaction of the Applicant and she witheld monies due to him on account o f that There was an initial issue of proceedings in the Magistrates Court in which recovery was sought from the Applicant for the balance of the monies allegedly owing for the work performed These proceedings were discontinued by consent and proceedings were subsequently issued in this Tribunal by the Applicant in these proceedings the Defendant in the complaint in the Magistrates Court proceedings In these proceedings the Applicant seeks an order by way of compensation for loss for the payment of monies sufficient to rectify the works which in the Applicant's submission amounts to a complete demolishing and reconstruction of the works done With respect to the entities to the alleged agreement the Applicant is clearly the named individual On the other hand the Second Respondent who gave unsworn evidence by way of telephone communication  due to ill health contended that proceedings in the Tribunal have been inappropriately and incorrectly issued against the First Respondent He contends tha t the work was carried out by Consolidated Building Maintenance Pty Ltd a company whose existence ceased on   July   when its assets and liabilities were taken over by a company called Maintenance Team Pty Ltd whose Directors were the wife and step  daughter of the Second Respondent Consolidated Building Maintenance Pty Ltd  ACN       was a company which according to Mr Opat employed Mr Albie Beck through a decision of a Director Mr Ian Harding It was Mr Beck who initially at least wa s given the responsibility by Mr Opat of organising the sub  contractors and the work to be carried out at Mrs Buch's house Moreover it was to Consolidated Building Maintenance Pty Ltd that a cheque for   ,  was made out by Mrs Buch for part performanc e of the work carried out The Tribunal finds that the cheque was made out to this company at the request of Mr Opat and that until that time Mrs Buch was unaware of the existence of that company Maintenance Team Pty Ltd  ACN       to which refe rence is made above is only relevant insofar as a   ,  cash further payment paid to Mr Opat by Mrs Buch for the work performed was said by Mr Opat to have been received by him on behalf of Maintenance Team Pty Ltd Mr Opat supports this contention by re ference to what on its face is a receipt for that cash on the letter  head of Maintenance Team Pty Ltd from P.O Box   Cheltenham and dated   October   Counsel for the Applicant attempted to discredit the evidentiary value of that receipt by rai sing issues concerning the date from which the prefix '  was attached to Melbourne telephone numbers concerning the proper address of the subject company at that time and concerning the stage at which the particular receipt came to light To this it must be said that the relevant date is not within the Tribunal's knowledge and no evidence was led about it Further while the other matters raised by Counsel do tend to raise doubts about the authenticity of the receipt they are insufficient in themselves to altogether rebut their evidentiary value However when considered in the context of the receipt signed by Mr Opat and dated   October   for a    cash payment received from Mrs Buch and written on a 'With Compliments slip of Opat Decorating Se rvice Vic Pty Ltd the evidentiary value of the exhibited receipt from Maintenance Team Pty Ltd as

       " 'REASONS INTRODUCTION   The Applicant  ‘the Owner was the owner of a property located in Ocean Grove  ‘the Property upon which a residential dwelling was constructed by the Respondent ‘the Builder   The Owner purchased the Property in February   and arranged for it to be tenanted from that time until he eventually sold the Property in late     In or around the middle of   the Owner carried out an inspection of the Property in the presence of the leasing agent During the course of that inspection the Owner noticed staining to the plas ter ceiling and inside face of one of the exposed brick internal walls of the garage The Owner suspected that the staining was caused by water leaking into the garage ceiling space from the tiled balcony which form ed part of the garage roof The Owner th en instructed the leasing agent to investigate the suspected water leak Although the Owner was unable to say what work was subsequently organised by the leasing agent whatever was done did not remedy the leak as the tenant continued to complain that wat er was leaking into the garage from that area   As a result the Owner organised for the leasing agent to engage a builder to further investigate the leak To that end a large inspection opening was cut into the plasterboard ceiling in order to inspe ct the underside of the tiled balcony It was at that point that it was discovered that significant water had entered into the garage ceiling space presumably over a considerable period of time with the consequence that some of the timber framing had rot ted The Owner then contacted the Master Builders Association and obtained the contact details of the Builder At this point almost   months ha d elapsed since the water staining was first detected   On   October   the Builder inspected the Property Following that inspection it was agreed that the Builder would undertake remedial work which included replacing some of the ceiling timber frame That work was completed in November   Further sealing of various joints w as then carried out to ensure that the balcony deck remained watertight This included sealing around the junction of the balcony deck and a privacy screen The privacy screen had been constructed along the rear boundary of the balcony It returned along the outside boundary towards th e front of the balcony for approximately two metres and thereby formed the rear outside corner of the balcony This privacy screen had been fixed to the ceiling frame timbers with the balcony tiles being laid to its perimeter   After th e remedial work w as completed the Owner kept monitoring the balcony to ensure that it remained watertight However moisture could still be seen on the timber frame through the inspection opening cut in the  GTKH

In February   the Owner contacted the B uilder and advised that the balcony still leak ed Another meeting was arranged in March   following which further sealing was undertaken around the junction of the privacy screen and the deck tiles however without success   It was at this point th at the parties communication deteriorated It was also at this point that the Owner resolved to sell the Property despite the ongoing problem with water leaks As a result the Owner arranged to have the plaster ceiling repaired and painted prior to the Property being marketed for sale According to the Owner the Property was marketed with full disclosure of the water leak   Indeed during one open inspection day water was seen to cascade down the inside garage wall during heavy rain Notwithstanding the leak in the balcony deck the property sold in August     Following settlement the new owner contacted the Builder and arrangements were put into place which resulted in all of the balcony tiles being uplifted a new membrane laid and new tiles relayed This was done at the Builder s expense and has now proved to remedy the leaking water problem THE OWNER ’S CLAIM   The Owner contends that the leak was caused by bad workmanship in the construction of the deck and in particular the methodolo gy used to flash the junction of the privacy screen and the deck The Owner says that the failure to properly flash that area allowed water to build up against the privacy screen and then into the ceiling space where it eventually rotted some of the ceili ng timber frame   The Owner claims that the defective workmanship constitutes a breach of the warranties given by the Builder pursuant to s   of the Domestic Building Contracts Act   and that he is entitled to claim against a builder as a subsequen t owner of the Property pursuant to s   of that Act   The Owner claims damages in the amount of   , .  made up as follows  a    being the costs of the leasing agent in carrying out maintenance work relating to the water leak  b    being t he cost of silicon and other sundries in order to make good the water leak  c   .  being the cost of paint used to repaint the garage ceiling  d    being the cost of the deck sealer  e    being the cost to repair the plaster ceiling  GTKH \\x03XGTUKQP',\n",

Victoria   The Respondent Mr Adam  “the Builder was at all material times a registered builder The Contract   By an undated contract  “the Contract entered into on or about   October   the Builder agreed to construct an extension on the rear of the House and insert a decorative dormer window on the roof for the agreed price of   ,    The work was to be carried out in accordance with plans and specifications provided to the Builder There were also certain addition al work s to b e done which are described in Schedule   of the Contract   The Owner was to supply certain materials and to bear certain costs including underground power electrical connection telephone connection fees all electrical work and external paving The gas pipes were to be re laid up to the met re at the cost of the Builder with other costs to be borne by the Owner   The Owner was to supply all windows and doors and door frames rosettes for fitting in the ceiling all external doo rs all d oor furniture and all cabinetwork The Builder was to fit the bathroom wall cabinet the built in wardrobes in the three bedrooms the bathroom shaving cabinet the laundry trough and cabinet the bathroom basement and vanity and the en suite vanity cupboard   Taps and plumbing fittings were to be supplied by the Owner and fitted by the Builder as were the dishwasher shower screen and door the rod for the shower curtain the towel rails the soap holder the toilet paper holder smoke detectors ducted vacuum and garbage disposal unit a central heating unit the cooling unit the range hood and the ceiling exhaust fans The intercom electrical work and security system were to be provided by the Owner and there was no provision for the Builder to fit any of it   There were prime cost figures given for floor and wall tiling and the existing stormwater drainage pipes were to be replaced if they were found not to be PVC No sewer plumbing was required   The terms of the Contract we re negotiated on her behalf by her husband Mr Eid who was the person who dealt with the Builder on site and provided him with instructions He was also the principal witness for the Owner at the hearing I am satisfied that he was authorised by the O wner to deal with the Builder on her behalf and there was no suggestion to the contrary  GTKH \\x03XGTUKQP KIPGF\\x03D \\x03#WUV

At the time of the Contract the House was a modest double fronted Edwardian weatherboard with four principal rooms at the front and a kitchen laundry bathroom and meals area at the rear The rear section was to be demolished and was to be replaced with a large extension copying to some extent the style of the original House   The plans attached to the Contract are fairly basic with very little in the way of detail The extension at least doubled the area of the House Two new external doors were to be cut in the existing House with a provision in the plans that the existing structure will be made good Similarly some windows were to be installed in existing frames and the windows were to be made good The plans identify certain work as being required to be done to the front four rooms   The price included repair and reinstatement of all plasterwork to the existing House where necessary Under “external cladding it is provided that it will match existing and that the Contract price provides for all carpentry work and materials for “the repair and reinstatement of the existing House   The Owner claims that this mean s that the Builder was to renovate the whole of the existing House including the decorative fretwork and the front veranda I do not find that these things were included The pla ns are quite specific as to what was to be done to the existing House and these other items are not specified I should not infer from the general statement “repair and reinstatement of the existing House that it mean s anything other than making good the interface between the new and the old That was the interpretation of the Builder’s expert Mr Rob Lees and it is a sensible one   The whole of the Colou r bond roof including downpipes guttering capping and flashing was to be replaced by the Builder Time   There was no provision at all in the Contract as to how long the work was to take In the Points of C laim the Owner says that there was a verbal agreement that it be completed by   Apri l   That is denied in the Points of D efence The evi dence as to this by Mr Eid was that he discussed with the Builder how long it woul d take and the Builder said that he would complete the work in March or April   That seems more in the nature of an indication as to the Builder’s expectation than a contractual agreement to complete the work by a particular date The Builder denies any such agreement I am not satisfied that there was any completion date agreed   In the absence of any agreement the law implies an obligation upon the Builder to carry ou t the work within a reasonable time in all the circumstances Those circumstances would include such things as the extent and difficulty of the work the extent of any variations the weather and any  GTKH
